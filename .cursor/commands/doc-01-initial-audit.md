# doc-01-initial-audit

I have messy documentation that needs to be reorganized. Can you help me audit it?

Please analyze and tell me:
1. What documentation types exist (README, API docs, feature docs, etc.)
2. What's duplicated across multiple files
3. What's missing but should exist
4. Which documents are too large (>300 lines)
5. Suggested folder structure following Laravel-style organization

Output format:
- Current state summary
- Issues found (duplications, missing docs, oversized files)
- Recommended new structure
- Migration priority (what to fix first)

Here's my current documentation structure:
